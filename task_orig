Please create a simple Django Application to Create, View, and Delete contacts. Given the below table definition for contacts build a Django app that:
Creates a contact table as per the below spec.
Populates the contacts table with sample data via a seeder script.
Exposes a RESTful API to perform listing and CRUD operations on the contacts table.
Sends an email notification when a contact is deleted to a configurable email address.
Enforces that actions can only be performed by authenticated users with a certain roles:
One role that has read-only access
Another role that can read/add.
Another role that can read/add/delete
There should be a UI that will allow for the listing of contacts, creating a new contact, and deleting a contact.
When completing the project pay particular attention to:
Code Style
Leveraging native framework patterns
Adhering to framework best practices
Including as many unit tests as possible.

CREATE TABLE contacts (
  id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name varchar(255) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci DEFAULT NULL,
  email varchar(255) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE = InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT = 256 DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

Best regards,
